# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practicals

Welcome to my repository of weekly OOP practicals. This repository stores all the projects and assignments I complete as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. The projects are structured to demonstrate various OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## About

This repository contains a collection of practical assignments that focus on mastering core OOP concepts. Each project demonstrates different aspects of OOP, such as:
- Defining classes and creating objects
- Implementing inheritance and polymorphism
- Using constructors and destructors
- Encapsulating data with private and public access modifiers
- Designing abstract classes and interfaces

The projects will evolve in complexity as I progress through the course.

## Structure

The repository is organized into weekly folders, with each folder containing the relevant practical for that week.

```
/OOP-Practicals
  ├── Week-1
  │   ├── Practical-1
  │   │   ├── main.py
  │   │   ├── README.md
  │   │   └── requirements.txt
  │   ├── Practical-2
  │   └── ...
  ├── Week-2
  ├── Week-3
  └── ...
```

- Each practical folder may contain a `main.py` or other relevant files, depending on the language and specific project.
- `README.md` in each weekly folder will provide specific details about that week's project.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python (or any other language based on your preference)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Any additional libraries used, such as `unittest`, `pytest`, or `pandas`
- **Tools**: Any relevant IDEs or tools, such as PyCharm, VSCode, etc.

## How to Use

To run any of the practicals:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOP-Practicals.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder for the relevant week:
    ```
    cd OOP-Practicals/Week-1/Practical-1
    ```
3. Install the dependencies (if applicable):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the main program or script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (or any other relevant programming environment).
